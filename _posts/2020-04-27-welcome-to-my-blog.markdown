After years of thinking about it, I finally did it. 
I now have a blog. 

It's built with Jekyll and runs on GitHub Pages. 

The probability that I'll actually write a significant number of articles is quite low, but who knows. 

My main project will be a (hopefully) weekly series called: What I learned this week. 
You'll never guess what it's about.
