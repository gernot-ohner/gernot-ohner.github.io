- Got up at 2:30 am, because I kinda messed up with my jet lag. 
Spent some time writing WhatsApp messages to my friends and family at home and elsewhere.


- At 3 am, watched one Pomodoro of a Django tutorial on YouTube. 
Because I'm rather unenthusiastic about Python (and only watched the Django tutorial in the first place because I looked through the new RC jobs and like 2/3 said: "Stack: Django, React"), I spent the break between the pomodoros googling "why is python awesome".
Concluded that it isn't. (At least not for me. I'm the kind of person who loves his static type system)
Started reading the book 21st Century C and did that for a few hours. 
Took a nap from 6:30 to 7:30. 
Continued reading/studying the book. 


- At 9am, I went to Church. Some observations: 
    - Considering this is the largest city in the second largest Catholic country in the world, I expected a lot of people. There weren't. There were about 20 people in a building that could hold about 100.
    - Maybe they were watching online, because the mass was live-streamed using a smartphone camera.
    - I wore dress slacks and a shirt, because I'd read that you have to dress nice to church in Mexico. There was a local with a tank-top looking like he came directly from the gym. 
    - I didn't understand anything. Well, I understood about 10% of the words in the sermon, but that didn't even add up to a vague understanding of what it was about. 
    - At some point the priest may have been talking about me. At least he said something about an "alemán" and "turista" and I was the only one there fitting that description


- From 10 to 12 I sat in a coffee shop called Blend Station working on the C book again.
There my breakfast and my caffe latte cost 250 Pesos, or about 10€ (which is crazy price for Mexico!) but were both really good.

- After that I had my RC pre-batch call with my "onboarding buddy" Liv Märtens, who turned out to be super young (18?) but very nice! We talked for 2 hours instead of the scheduled 15 minutes. 
  

- After that I went for a quick run. Actually it went like this: 
    - Don't bring my phone because I was worried it might get stolen or wet. Be confident I know the way to the park and back. 
    - Run to the outdoor gym in Parque Mexico I discovered on the first day (10 mintues)
    - Do my workout there: Pull-ups, Deadlifts, some chest exercise. (15 minutes)
    - Start my run home (5 minutes)
    - Torrential rainfall starts pouring down. Hide under the canopy of the stall of some guy selling flowers (20 minutes)
    - Rain almost stops, I start running again and get disoriented. Run around in the city, being completely lost, even though I repeatedly asked locals for the way (1 hour).


- Spent 2 hours doing [Regex Crosswords](https://regexcrossword.com/) which I had discovered through someone on Zulip (the RC communications platform) talking about it. 


- Managed to stay up until 9pm.
