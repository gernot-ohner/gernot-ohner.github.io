For multiple reasons, I was very torn by this book. 

On the one hand, this book is hilarious. It may be the funniest book I've ever read. 
Brysons humor is quite dark, but if you can get on board with that, you'll have a blast.

On the other hand I could not help but be disappointed by this book.
This was probably a failure of expectations. 

What I was looking for in this book was a look into American small town life. 
What I found instead was a guy on a road trip, always staying in hotels, 
never spending more than a day in any town he visits. 
This is not an approach that lends itself to particularly deep insights about said towns, to say the least.

Somehow, Bryson takes a 20000 kilometer long road trip through the United States,
stumbling through wonder above wonder, horror above horror, and somehow manages to be bored most of the time.
