Hi, my name is Gernot Ohner, but at the Recurse Center, where I am now, I go by Sam
(because I can't stand it when someone calls me GÃ¶rnot, which native english speakers like to do).

As I mentioned, I'm currently doing a batch at the Recurse Center (https://www.recurse.com), a "self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers".
I'm from Austria, but right now, I'm located in Mexico City. 

Before what I was Junior Software Engineer at BearingPoint in Graz, where 
I worked with Java, Kafka, and Kubernetes.
